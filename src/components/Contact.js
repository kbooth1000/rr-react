      <div className="deck">
        <p><i>For most people, HVAC contact is a large expense, and can be challenging
              for anyone, especially a new homeowner. While paying out of pocket is the
              best option, there are plenty of options to finance the HVAC system that
              is right for you.</i></p>
        <p>The cost to install a new HVAC system can vary based on:
<ul>
            <li>The type of equipment being installed (full system or replacement parts);</li>
            <li>The existing equipment (age and location);</li>
            <li>And the type of install (new install or replace existing)</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>What to Know Before You Buy</h2>
        <p><strong>Home Equity</strong></p>
        <p>
          Borrowing against the equity in your home can often be a good way to
          finance home improvements. This option has less interest and is tax-deductible,
          but there are risks. Falling behind on your payment could cost you not only
            your HVAC system but your home.</p>

        <p><strong>Private Lenders</strong></p>
        <p>You can also borrow from private lenders, such as banks or credit unions.
    The interest rates and max amounts available to borrow will vary, but many banks
        have low-interest rates for these types of loans.</p>

        <p><strong>Loan Programs</strong></p>
        <p>There are loan programs, such as the Federal Housing Administrationâ€™s (FHA)
        PowerSaver Loan Program, that allow you to borrow up to $7,500 without putting
        up your home as collateral. However, you must have home equity to participate.</p>

        <p><strong>Credit Card Companies</strong></p>
        <p>Talk to your credit card company about charging this large of a purchase to
        your card. Know that there is a possibility of higher interest rates.</p>

        <p><strong>Utility Companies</strong></p>
        <p>Utility companies can also help by charging monthly payments for your new HVAC
        system on your electric bill. They often provide low-interest rates if you choose
              energy-efficient systems.</p>
