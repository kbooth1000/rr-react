      <div> <p>HVAC FINANCING 101</p>
        <p><i>For most people, HVAC financing is a large expense, and can be challenging 
              for anyone, especially a new homeowner. While paying out of pocket is the 
              best option, there are plenty of options to finance the HVAC system that 
              is right for you.</i></p>
        <p><i>The cost to install a new HVAC system can vary based on:

              The type of equipment being installed (full system or replacement parts);
              The existing equipment (age and location);
              And the type of install (new install or replace existing)</i></p>
        <p><i>What to Know Before You Buy</i></p>
        <p><i>Home Equity
              Borrowing against the equity in your home can often be a good way to 
              finance home improvements. This option has less interest and is tax-deductible, 
              but there are risks. Falling behind on your payment could cost you not only 
              your HVAC system but your home.

              <i>Private Lenders</i>
              You can also borrow from private lenders, such as banks or credit unions. 
              The interest rates and max amounts available to borrow will vary, but many banks 
              have low-interest rates for these types of loans.

              Loan Programs
              There are loan programs, such as the Federal Housing Administrationâ€™s (FHA) 
              PowerSaver Loan Program, that allow you to borrow up to $7,500 without putting 
              up your home as collateral. However, you must have home equity to participate.

              Credit Card Companies
              Talk to your credit card company about charging this large of a purchase to 
              your card. Know that there is a possibility of higher interest rates.

              Utility Companies
              Utility companies can also help by charging monthly payments for your new HVAC 
              system on your electric bill. They often provide low-interest rates if you choose 
              energy-efficient systems.</i></p>
