        <p><i>Heat Pumps are Common in the South and Provide heat and air conditioning</i></p>
        <p><i>Both the electric furnace and the heat pump use all electric 
              to produce heat. However, they do it in different ways and the heat 
              pump, if properly installed, is far more efficient. More efficient 
              when operating in the heat pump mode than the electric furnace. It may 
              sound contradictory when I tell you that electric heat for the electric 
              furnace is 100% efficient. All of the heat the electric furnace produces is 
              used to heat your home.</i></p>
